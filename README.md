# Neutral Vault

Neutral vault is our attempt to bring traditional fund management to the decentralized finance and allow general public access to the world's best fund managers. There are many interesting projects happening in the blockchain industry and there are many people out there with an eye for spotting these projects and then backing them with capital.

Neutral Vault allows any fund manager to launch different vaults with varying APY, in which general public can pool in money and allow the fund manager to deploy these assets to projects as part of their investment strategy. This allows fund managaers to raise capital from public, deploy it to projects they want to back and help the investors get the promised APY.
